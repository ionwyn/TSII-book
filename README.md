# TSII-book
That Stuff is Interesting by Ionwyn Sean, a TeX based project to build open knowledge base of stuff you find interesting.

# Prerequisites
- Advanced to expert knowledge in TeX.  I apologize as TeX is already de-facto standard for typesetting beautiful documents.
- Interest in building an open source knowledge base for yourself and others

# Running
-  shareLaTeX for using it on the web
- Use MiKTeX for Windows
- TeX Live for Linux and other UNIX-like systems <- This is what I use
- MacTeX redistribution of TeX Live for Mac OS X
- teTeX for Linux and other UNIX-like systems, now is no longer actively maintained
- proTeXt is based on MiKTeX

# How I hope it works (1x zoom)
1. Each person can create their own branch (or fork) to build their own knowledge base.
2. Each person can contribute to someone else's knowledge base by submitting pull request to the respective branch (or repo).
3. The master repo is a combination of all the knowledge base everyone has gathered.

# How I hope it works (10x zoom)
1. If you want to build your own, please update the README.md file (this one) and add your own name along with the link to the fork (or repo, or branch).  Also list topics that you are interested in.
2. Create a fork
3. Submit Pull Request when you want to share it with the master repo

# How it works (100x zoom)
- TSII.tex is the main file.  It utilizes the file `header.tex` as this will be the main includes and standards for all Math typesetting.
- Everything else are topics with their respective subtopics
